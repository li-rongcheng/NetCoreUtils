# About RCM

RCM stands for Robocopy Configuration Manager

## ToDo

### Current

### Waiting

- Need a "simulating" flag in the config file. When this flag is on, the actual robocopy command won't be executed.
- Support alias for source/target pathes
  - Use path alias to update backup items
- Need a validation method to validate the configuration file

### More Thoughts

- Need a RestoreCommand, which uses the same backup config but sync from the target to the source

## Done
